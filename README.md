I was really looking forward to participate to this anniversary edition, but due to personal circumstances (everything is fine, not to worry) I couldn't really dedicate 2 days, or even more than a few hours. I originally had planned to just post a short static text and call it an entry, just for the sake of participating, but... yeah I had to make that a game of course!
